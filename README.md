# Calculate-WISE-SFR-and-stellar-masses-of-galaxies
This notebook recalculated SFR and stellar masses use WISE photometry published in Parkash et al. (2018) using different distances.
These distances were complied by Robert D for sample of Ring galaxies. 

Tables: 
For_WISE.csv -- table provided by Robert including galaxy name, RA, DEC, & distance. I have saved the new SFR and stellar mass to this table

HIPASS_2018 - csv file containing the data of the HI+WISE sample (Parkash et al., 2018). Note this is not the table that was published with the paper, but my personal "messy" verison of the data.
